         description:
            This functionality renders text over items to indicate what material it is.

            This can be quite helpful for similar looking items, such as ingots, where often the color is the only way
            to identify them at a glance. This can be problematic, be it due to colorblindness, or just due to there
            being like 100 different ingots with very minor color differences.

      matchers:
         title: Item Material Overlay Matchers
         description:
            The matchers are ways to determine the material of an item.

            This is primarily done by pattern matching on properties like id and tags.

      mappings:
         title: Item Material Overlay Mappings
         description:
            The matchers determine the material names of the items, but these can be quite long and somewhat cryptic.
            Some of them might not even be useful to you.

            Because of this these material names are not shown directly.
            Instead, this mapping is used to determine the text to show for each material.
            If a material is not in this mapping, no overlay will be shown for it.
         add: Add Mapping
         confirm-delete: Are you sure you want to delete this mapping?
