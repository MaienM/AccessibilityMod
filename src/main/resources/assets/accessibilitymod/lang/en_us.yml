         description:
            The matchers are ways to determine the material of an item.

            This is primarily done by pattern matching on properties like id and tags.

      mapping:
         title: Item Overlay Mappings
         description:
            The matchers determine the material names of the items, but these can be quite long and somewhat cryptic.
            Some of them might not even be useful to you.

            Because of this these material names are not shown directly.
            Instead, this mapping is used to determine the text to show for each material.
            If a material is not in this mapping, no overlay will be shown for it.
